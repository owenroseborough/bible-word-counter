Psalm 16

You Will Not Abandon My Soul

A Miktam(1) of David.

    [1] Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
    [2] I say to the LORD, “You are my Lord;
        I have no good apart from you.”
    
    
    [3] As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones,
        in whom is all my delight.(2)
    
    
    [4] The sorrows of those who run after(3) another god shall multiply;
        their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out
        or take their names on my lips.
    
    
    [5] The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup;
        you hold my lot.
    [6] The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
        indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
    
    
    [7] I bless the LORD who gives me counsel;
        in the night also my heart instructs me.(4)
    [8] I have set the LORD always before me;
        because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.
    
    
    [9] Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being(5) rejoices;
        my flesh also dwells secure.
    [10] For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,
        or let your holy one see corruption.(6)
    
    
    [11] You make known to me the path of life;
        in your presence there is fullness of joy;
        at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
