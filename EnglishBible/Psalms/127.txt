Psalm 127

Unless the LORD Builds the House

A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon.

    [1] Unless the LORD builds the house,
        those who build it labor in vain.
    Unless the LORD watches over the city,
        the watchman stays awake in vain.
    [2] It is in vain that you rise up early
        and go late to rest,
    eating the bread of anxious toil;
        for he gives to his beloved sleep.
    
    
    [3] Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD,
        the fruit of the womb a reward.
    [4] Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
        are the children(1) of oneâ€™s youth.
    [5] Blessed is the man
        who fills his quiver with them!
    He shall not be put to shame
        when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.(2)
