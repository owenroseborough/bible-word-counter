Psalm 1

Book One

The Way of the Righteous and the Wicked

    [1] Blessed is the man(1)
        who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
    nor stands in the way of sinners,
        nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
    [2] but his delight is in the law(2) of the LORD,
        and on his law he meditates day and night.
    
    
    [3] He is like a tree
        planted by streams of water
    that yields its fruit in its season,
        and its leaf does not wither.
    In all that he does, he prospers.
    [4] The wicked are not so,
        but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
    
    
    [5] Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
        nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
    [6] for the LORD knows the way of the righteous,
        but the way of the wicked will perish.
