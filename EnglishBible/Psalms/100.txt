Psalm 100

His Steadfast Love Endures Forever

A Psalm for giving thanks.

    [1] Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth!
    [2]     Serve the LORD with gladness!
        Come into his presence with singing!
    
    
    [3] Know that the LORD, he is God!
        It is he who made us, and we are his;(1)
        we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
    
    
    [4] Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
        and his courts with praise!
        Give thanks to him; bless his name!
    
    
    [5] For the LORD is good;
        his steadfast love endures forever,
        and his faithfulness to all generations.
