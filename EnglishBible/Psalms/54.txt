Psalm 54

The Lord Upholds My Life

To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments. A Maskil(1) of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, “Is not David hiding among us?”

    [1] O God, save me by your name,
        and vindicate me by your might.
    [2] O God, hear my prayer;
        give ear to the words of my mouth.
    
    
    [3] For strangers(2) have risen against me;
        ruthless men seek my life;
        they do not set God before themselves. Selah
    
    
    [4] Behold, God is my helper;
        the Lord is the upholder of my life.
    [5] He will return the evil to my enemies;
        in your faithfulness put an end to them.
    
    
    [6] With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you;
        I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good.
    [7] For he has delivered me from every trouble,
        and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
