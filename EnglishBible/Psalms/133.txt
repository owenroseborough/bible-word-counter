Psalm 133

When Brothers Dwell in Unity

A Song of Ascents. Of David.

    [1] Behold, how good and pleasant it is
        when brothers dwell in unity!(1)
    [2] It is like the precious oil on the head,
        running down on the beard,
    on the beard of Aaron,
        running down on the collar of his robes!
    [3] It is like the dew of Hermon,
        which falls on the mountains of Zion!
    For there the LORD has commanded the blessing,
        life forevermore.
