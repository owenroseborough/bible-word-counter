Psalm 150

Let Everything Praise the LORD

    [1] Praise the LORD!
    Praise God in his sanctuary;
        praise him in his mighty heavens!(1)
    [2] Praise him for his mighty deeds;
        praise him according to his excellent greatness!
    
    
    [3] Praise him with trumpet sound;
        praise him with lute and harp!
    [4] Praise him with tambourine and dance;
        praise him with strings and pipe!
    [5] Praise him with sounding cymbals;
        praise him with loud clashing cymbals!
    [6] Let everything that has breath praise the LORD!
    Praise the LORD!
