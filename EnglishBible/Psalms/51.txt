Psalm 51

Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God

To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

    [1] Have mercy on me,(1) O God,
        according to your steadfast love;
    according to your abundant mercy
        blot out my transgressions.
    [2] Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
        and cleanse me from my sin!
    
    
    [3] For I know my transgressions,
        and my sin is ever before me.
    [4] Against you, you only, have I sinned
        and done what is evil in your sight,
    so that you may be justified in your words
        and blameless in your judgment.
    [5] Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
        and in sin did my mother conceive me.
    [6] Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,
        and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.
    
    
    [7] Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
        wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
    [8] Let me hear joy and gladness;
        let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
    [9] Hide your face from my sins,
        and blot out all my iniquities.
    [10] Create in me a clean heart, O God,
        and renew a right(2) spirit within me.
    [11] Cast me not away from your presence,
        and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
    [12] Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
        and uphold me with a willing spirit.
    
    
    [13] Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
        and sinners will return to you.
    [14] Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
        O God of my salvation,
        and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
    [15] O Lord, open my lips,
        and my mouth will declare your praise.
    [16] For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
        you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
    [17] The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
        a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
    
    
    [18] Do good to Zion in your good pleasure;
        build up the walls of Jerusalem;
    [19] then will you delight in right sacrifices,
        in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;
        then bulls will be offered on your altar.
