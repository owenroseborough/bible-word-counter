Psalm 6

O LORD, Deliver My Life

To the choirmaster: with stringed instruments; according to The Sheminith.(1) A Psalm of David.

    [1] O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger,
        nor discipline me in your wrath.
    [2] Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing;
        heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled.
    [3] My soul also is greatly troubled.
        But you, O LORDâ€”how long?
    
    
    [4] Turn, O LORD, deliver my life;
        save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
    [5] For in death there is no remembrance of you;
        in Sheol who will give you praise?
    
    
    [6] I am weary with my moaning;
        every night I flood my bed with tears;
        I drench my couch with my weeping.
    [7] My eye wastes away because of grief;
        it grows weak because of all my foes.
    
    
    [8] Depart from me, all you workers of evil,
        for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping.
    [9] The LORD has heard my plea;
        the LORD accepts my prayer.
    [10] All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;
        they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.
