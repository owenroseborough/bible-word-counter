Psalm 30

Joy Comes with the Morning

A Psalm of David. A song at the dedication of the temple.

    [1] I will extol you, O LORD, for you have drawn me up
        and have not let my foes rejoice over me.
    [2] O LORD my God, I cried to you for help,
        and you have healed me.
    [3] O LORD, you have brought up my soul from Sheol;
        you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit.(1)
    
    
    [4] Sing praises to the LORD, O you his saints,
        and give thanks to his holy name.(2)
    [5] For his anger is but for a moment,
        and his favor is for a lifetime.(3)
    Weeping may tarry for the night,
        but joy comes with the morning.
    
    
    [6] As for me, I said in my prosperity,
        “I shall never be moved.”
    [7] By your favor, O LORD,
        you made my mountain stand strong;
    you hid your face;
        I was dismayed.
    
    
    [8] To you, O LORD, I cry,
        and to the Lord I plead for mercy:
    [9] “What profit is there in my death,(4)
        if I go down to the pit?(5)
    Will the dust praise you?
        Will it tell of your faithfulness?
    [10] Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me!
        O LORD, be my helper!”
    
    
    [11] You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;
        you have loosed my sackcloth
        and clothed me with gladness,
    [12] that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent.
        O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
