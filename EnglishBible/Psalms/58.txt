Psalm 58

God Who Judges the Earth

To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Miktam(1) of David.

    [1] Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods?(2)
        Do you judge the children of man uprightly?
    [2] No, in your hearts you devise wrongs;
        your hands deal out violence on earth.
    
    
    [3] The wicked are estranged from the womb;
        they go astray from birth, speaking lies.
    [4] They have venom like the venom of a serpent,
        like the deaf adder that stops its ear,
    [5] so that it does not hear the voice of charmers
        or of the cunning enchanter.
    
    
    [6] O God, break the teeth in their mouths;
        tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!
    [7] Let them vanish like water that runs away;
        when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted.
    [8] Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime,
        like the stillborn child who never sees the sun.
    [9] Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns,
        whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away!(3)
    
    
    [10] The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
        he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.
    [11] Mankind will say, “Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
        surely there is a God who judges on earth.”
