Psalm 24

The King of Glory

A Psalm of David.

    [1] The earth is the LORDâ€™s and the fullness thereof,(1)
        the world and those who dwell therein,
    [2] for he has founded it upon the seas
        and established it upon the rivers.
    
    
    [3] Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD?
        And who shall stand in his holy place?
    [4] He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
        who does not lift up his soul to what is false
        and does not swear deceitfully.
    [5] He will receive blessing from the LORD
        and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
    [6] Such is the generation of those who seek him,
        who seek the face of the God of Jacob.(2) Selah
    
    
    [7] Lift up your heads, O gates!
        And be lifted up, O ancient doors,
        that the King of glory may come in.
    [8] Who is this King of glory?
        The LORD, strong and mighty,
        the LORD, mighty in battle!
    [9] Lift up your heads, O gates!
        And lift them up, O ancient doors,
        that the King of glory may come in.
    [10] Who is this King of glory?
        The LORD of hosts,
        he is the King of glory! Selah
