Psalm 29

Ascribe to the LORD Glory

A Psalm of David.

    [1] Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings,(1)
        ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
    [2] Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name;
        worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness.(2)
    
    
    [3] The voice of the LORD is over the waters;
        the God of glory thunders,
        the LORD, over many waters.
    [4] The voice of the LORD is powerful;
        the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
    
    
    [5] The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars;
        the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon.
    [6] He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf,
        and Sirion like a young wild ox.
    
    
    [7] The voice of the LORD flashes forth flames of fire.
    [8] The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness;
        the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
    
    
    [9] The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth(3)
        and strips the forests bare,
        and in his temple all cry, “Glory!”
    
    
    [10] The LORD sits enthroned over the flood;
        the LORD sits enthroned as king forever.
    [11] May the LORD give strength to his people!
        May the LORD bless(4) his people with peace!
