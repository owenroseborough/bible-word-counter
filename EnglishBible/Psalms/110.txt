Psalm 110

Sit at My Right Hand

A Psalm of David.

    [1] The LORD says to my Lord:
        “Sit at my right hand,
    until I make your enemies your footstool.”
    
    
    [2] The LORD sends forth from Zion
        your mighty scepter.
        Rule in the midst of your enemies!
    [3] Your people will offer themselves freely
        on the day of your power,(1)
        in holy garments;(2)
    from the womb of the morning,
        the dew of your youth will be yours.(3)
    [4] The LORD has sworn
        and will not change his mind,
    “You are a priest forever
        after the order of Melchizedek.”
    
    
    [5] The Lord is at your right hand;
        he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath.
    [6] He will execute judgment among the nations,
        filling them with corpses;
    he will shatter chiefs(4)
        over the wide earth.
    [7] He will drink from the brook by the way;
        therefore he will lift up his head.
