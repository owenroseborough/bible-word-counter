Psalm 60

He Will Tread Down Our Foes

To the choirmaster: according to Shushan Eduth. A Miktam(1) of David; for instruction; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and when Joab on his return struck down twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.

    [1] O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses;
        you have been angry; oh, restore us.
    [2] You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open;
        repair its breaches, for it totters.
    [3] You have made your people see hard things;
        you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger.
    
    
    [4] You have set up a banner for those who fear you,
        that they may flee to it from the bow.(2) Selah
    [5] That your beloved ones may be delivered,
        give salvation by your right hand and answer us!
    
    
    [6] God has spoken in his holiness:(3)
        “With exultation I will divide up Shechem
        and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
    [7] Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
        Ephraim is my helmet;
        Judah is my scepter.
    [8] Moab is my washbasin;
        upon Edom I cast my shoe;
        over Philistia I shout in triumph.”(4)
    
    
    [9] Who will bring me to the fortified city?
        Who will lead me to Edom?
    [10] Have you not rejected us, O God?
        You do not go forth, O God, with our armies.
    [11] Oh, grant us help against the foe,
        for vain is the salvation of man!
    [12] With God we shall do valiantly;
        it is he who will tread down our foes.
