Psalm 27

The LORD Is My Light and My Salvation

Of David.

    [1] The LORD is my light and my salvation;
        whom shall I fear?
    The LORD is the stronghold(1) of my life;
        of whom shall I be afraid?
    
    
    [2] When evildoers assail me
        to eat up my flesh,
    my adversaries and foes,
        it is they who stumble and fall.
    
    
    [3] Though an army encamp against me,
        my heart shall not fear;
    though war arise against me,
        yet(2) I will be confident.
    
    
    [4] One thing have I asked of the LORD,
        that will I seek after:
    that I may dwell in the house of the LORD
        all the days of my life,
    to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD
        and to inquire(3) in his temple.
    
    
    [5] For he will hide me in his shelter
        in the day of trouble;
    he will conceal me under the cover of his tent;
        he will lift me high upon a rock.
    
    
    [6] And now my head shall be lifted up
        above my enemies all around me,
    and I will offer in his tent
        sacrifices with shouts of joy;
    I will sing and make melody to the LORD.
    
    
    [7] Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud;
        be gracious to me and answer me!
    [8] You have said, “Seek(4) my face.”
    My heart says to you,
        “Your face, LORD, do I seek.”(5)
    [9]     Hide not your face from me.
    Turn not your servant away in anger,
        O you who have been my help.
    Cast me not off; forsake me not,
        O God of my salvation!
    [10] For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
        but the LORD will take me in.
    
    
    [11] Teach me your way, O LORD,
        and lead me on a level path
        because of my enemies.
    [12] Give me not up to the will of my adversaries;
        for false witnesses have risen against me,
        and they breathe out violence.
    
    
    [13] I believe that I shall look(6) upon the goodness of the LORD
        in the land of the living!
    [14] Wait for the LORD;
        be strong, and let your heart take courage;
        wait for the LORD!
