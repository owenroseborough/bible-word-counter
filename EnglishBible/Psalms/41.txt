Psalm 41

O LORD, Be Gracious to Me

To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.

    [1] Blessed is the one who considers the poor!(1)
        In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him;
    [2] the LORD protects him and keeps him alive;
        he is called blessed in the land;
        you do not give him up to the will of his enemies.
    [3] The LORD sustains him on his sickbed;
        in his illness you restore him to full health.(2)
    
    
    [4] As for me, I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me;
        heal me,(3) for I have sinned against you!”
    [5] My enemies say of me in malice,
        “When will he die, and his name perish?”
    [6] And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words,
        while his heart gathers iniquity;
        when he goes out, he tells it abroad.
    [7] All who hate me whisper together about me;
        they imagine the worst for me.(4)
    
    
    [8] They say, “A deadly thing is poured out(5) on him;
        he will not rise again from where he lies.”
    [9] Even my close friend in whom I trusted,
        who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me.
    [10] But you, O LORD, be gracious to me,
        and raise me up, that I may repay them!
    
    
    [11] By this I know that you delight in me:
        my enemy will not shout in triumph over me.
    [12] But you have upheld me because of my integrity,
        and set me in your presence forever.
    
    
    [13] Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
        from everlasting to everlasting!
                                  Amen and Amen.
