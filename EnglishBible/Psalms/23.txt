Psalm 23

The LORD Is My Shepherd

A Psalm of David.

    [1] The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
    [2]     He makes me lie down in green pastures.
    He leads me beside still waters.(1)
    [3]     He restores my soul.
    He leads me in paths of righteousness(2)
        for his nameâ€™s sake.
    
    
    [4] Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,(3)
        I will fear no evil,
    for you are with me;
        your rod and your staff,
        they comfort me.
    
    
    [5] You prepare a table before me
        in the presence of my enemies;
    you anoint my head with oil;
        my cup overflows.
    [6] Surely(4) goodness and mercy(5) shall follow me
        all the days of my life,
    and I shall dwell(6) in the house of the LORD
        forever.(7)
