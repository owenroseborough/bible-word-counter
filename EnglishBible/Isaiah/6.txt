Isaiah 6

Isaiah’s Vision of the Lord

  [1] In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train(1) of his robe filled the temple. [2] Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. [3] And one called to another and said:

    “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;
    the whole earth is full of his glory!”(2)
    
    
      [4] And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. [5] And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!”

  [6] Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. [7] And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

Isaiah’s Commission from the Lord

  [8] And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.” [9] And he said, “Go, and say to this people:

    “‘Keep on hearing,(3) but do not understand;
    keep on seeing,(4) but do not perceive.’
    [10] Make the heart of this people dull,(5)
        and their ears heavy,
        and blind their eyes;
    lest they see with their eyes,
        and hear with their ears,
    and understand with their hearts,
        and turn and be healed.”
    [11] Then I said, “How long, O Lord?”
    And he said:
    “Until cities lie waste
        without inhabitant,
    and houses without people,
        and the land is a desolate waste,
    [12] and the LORD removes people far away,
        and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
    [13] And though a tenth remain in it,
        it will be burned(6) again,
    like a terebinth or an oak,
        whose stump remains
        when it is felled.”
    The holy seed(7) is its stump.
