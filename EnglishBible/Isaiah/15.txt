Isaiah 15

An Oracle Concerning Moab

  [1] An oracle concerning Moab.

    Because Ar of Moab is laid waste in a night,
        Moab is undone;
    because Kir of Moab is laid waste in a night,
        Moab is undone.
    [2] He has gone up to the temple,(1) and to Dibon,
        to the high places(2) to weep;
    over Nebo and over Medeba
        Moab wails.
    On every head is baldness;
        every beard is shorn;
    [3] in the streets they wear sackcloth;
        on the housetops and in the squares
        everyone wails and melts in tears.
    [4] Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;
        their voice is heard as far as Jahaz;
    therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud;
        his soul trembles.
    [5] My heart cries out for Moab;
        her fugitives flee to Zoar,
        to Eglath-shelishiyah.
    For at the ascent of Luhith
        they go up weeping;
    on the road to Horonaim
        they raise a cry of destruction;
    [6] the waters of Nimrim
        are a desolation;
    the grass is withered, the vegetation fails,
        the greenery is no more.
    [7] Therefore the abundance they have gained
        and what they have laid up
    they carry away
        over the Brook of the Willows.
    [8] For a cry has gone
        around the land of Moab;
    her wailing reaches to Eglaim;
        her wailing reaches to Beer-elim.
    [9] For the waters of Dibon(3) are full of blood;
        for I will bring upon Dibon even more,
    a lion for those of Moab who escape,
        for the remnant of the land.
