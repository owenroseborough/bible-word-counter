Isaiah 64

    [1] Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,
        that the mountains might quake at your presence—
    [2] (1) as when fire kindles brushwood
        and the fire causes water to boil—
    to make your name known to your adversaries,
        and that the nations might tremble at your presence!
    [3] When you did awesome things that we did not look for,
        you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
    [4] From of old no one has heard
        or perceived by the ear,
    no eye has seen a God besides you,
        who acts for those who wait for him.
    [5] You meet him who joyfully works righteousness,
        those who remember you in your ways.
    Behold, you were angry, and we sinned;
        in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?(2)
    [6] We have all become like one who is unclean,
        and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment.
    We all fade like a leaf,
        and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
    [7] There is no one who calls upon your name,
        who rouses himself to take hold of you;
    for you have hidden your face from us,
        and have made us melt in(3) the hand of our iniquities.
    
    
    [8] But now, O LORD, you are our Father;
        we are the clay, and you are our potter;
        we are all the work of your hand.
    [9] Be not so terribly angry, O LORD,
        and remember not iniquity forever.
        Behold, please look, we are all your people.
    [10] Your holy cities have become a wilderness;
        Zion has become a wilderness,
        Jerusalem a desolation.
    [11] Our holy and beautiful(4) house,
        where our fathers praised you,
    has been burned by fire,
        and all our pleasant places have become ruins.
    [12] Will you restrain yourself at these things, O LORD?
        Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly?
