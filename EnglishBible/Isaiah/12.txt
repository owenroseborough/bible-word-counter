Isaiah 12

The LORD Is My Strength and My Song

    [1] You(1) will say in that day:
    “I will give thanks to you, O LORD,
        for though you were angry with me,
    your anger turned away,
        that you might comfort me.
    
    
    [2] “Behold, God is my salvation;
        I will trust, and will not be afraid;
    for the LORD GOD(2) is my strength and my song,
        and he has become my salvation.”
    
    
      [3] With joy you(3) will draw water from the wells of salvation. [4] And you will say in that day:

    “Give thanks to the LORD,
        call upon his name,
    make known his deeds among the peoples,
        proclaim that his name is exalted.
    
    
    [5] “Sing praises to the LORD, for he has done gloriously;
        let this be made known(4) in all the earth.
    [6] Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion,
        for great in your(5) midst is the Holy One of Israel.”
