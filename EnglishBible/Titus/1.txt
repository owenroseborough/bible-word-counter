Titus 1

Greeting

  [1] Paul, a servant(1) of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness, [2] in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began(2) [3] and at the proper time manifested in his word(3) through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior;

  [4] To Titus, my true child in a common faith:

  Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

Qualifications for Elders

  [5] This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you—[6] if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife,(4) and his children are believers(5) and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination. [7] For an overseer,(6) as God’s steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, [8] but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. [9] He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound(7) doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.

  [10] For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party.(8) [11] They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach. [12] One of the Cretans,(9) a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”(10) [13] This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, [14] not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. [15] To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. [16] They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.
