Proverbs 9

The Way of Wisdom

    [1] Wisdom has built her house;
        she has hewn her seven pillars.
    [2] She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine;
        she has also set her table.
    [3] She has sent out her young women to call
        from the highest places in the town,
    [4] “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
        To him who lacks sense she says,
    [5] “Come, eat of my bread
        and drink of the wine I have mixed.
    [6] Leave your simple ways,(1) and live,
        and walk in the way of insight.”
    
    
    [7] Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,
        and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.
    [8] Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;
        reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
    [9] Give instruction(2) to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;
        teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
    [10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,
        and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
    [11] For by me your days will be multiplied,
        and years will be added to your life.
    [12] If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;
        if you scoff, you alone will bear it.
    
    
    The Way of Folly

    [13] The woman Folly is loud;
        she is seductive(3) and knows nothing.
    [14] She sits at the door of her house;
        she takes a seat on the highest places of the town,
    [15] calling to those who pass by,
        who are going straight on their way,
    [16] “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
        And to him who lacks sense she says,
    [17] “Stolen water is sweet,
        and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”
    [18] But he does not know that the dead(4) are there,
        that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
