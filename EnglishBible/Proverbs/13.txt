Proverbs 13

    [1] A wise son hears his father’s instruction,
        but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.
    [2] From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good,
        but the desire of the treacherous is for violence.
    [3] Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life;
        he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.
    [4] The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,
        while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.
    [5] The righteous hates falsehood,
        but the wicked brings shame(1) and disgrace.
    [6] Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless,
        but sin overthrows the wicked.
    [7] One pretends to be rich,(2) yet has nothing;
        another pretends to be poor,(3) yet has great wealth.
    [8] The ransom of a man’s life is his wealth,
        but a poor man hears no threat.
    [9] The light of the righteous rejoices,
        but the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
    [10] By insolence comes nothing but strife,
        but with those who take advice is wisdom.
    [11] Wealth gained hastily(4) will dwindle,
        but whoever gathers little by little will increase it.
    [12] Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
        but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.
    [13] Whoever despises the word(5) brings destruction on himself,
        but he who reveres the commandment(6) will be rewarded.
    [14] The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
        that one may turn away from the snares of death.
    [15] Good sense wins favor,
        but the way of the treacherous is their ruin.(7)
    [16] Every prudent man acts with knowledge,
        but a fool flaunts his folly.
    [17] A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
        but a faithful envoy brings healing.
    [18] Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction,
        but whoever heeds reproof is honored.
    [19] A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul,
        but to turn away from evil is an abomination to fools.
    [20] Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise,
        but the companion of fools will suffer harm.
    [21] Disaster(8) pursues sinners,
        but the righteous are rewarded with good.
    [22] A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
        but the sinner’s wealth is laid up for the righteous.
    [23] The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food,
        but it is swept away through injustice.
    [24] Whoever spares the rod hates his son,
        but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.(9)
    [25] The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,
        but the belly of the wicked suffers want.
