Nahum 2

The Destruction of Nineveh

    [1] The scatterer has come up against you.
        Man the ramparts;
        watch the road;
    dress for battle;(1)
        collect all your strength.
    
    
    [2] For the LORD is restoring the majesty of Jacob
        as the majesty of Israel,
    for plunderers have plundered them
        and ruined their branches.
    
    
    [3] The shield of his mighty men is red;
        his soldiers are clothed in scarlet.
    The chariots come with flashing metal
        on the day he musters them;
        the cypress spears are brandished.
    [4] The chariots race madly through the streets;
        they rush to and fro through the squares;
    they gleam like torches;
        they dart like lightning.
    [5] He remembers his officers;
        they stumble as they go,
    they hasten to the wall;
        the siege tower(2) is set up.
    [6] The river gates are opened;
        the palace melts away;
    [7] its mistress(3) is stripped;(4) she is carried off,
        her slave girls lamenting,
    moaning like doves
        and beating their breasts.
    [8] Nineveh is like a pool
        whose waters run away.(5)
    “Halt! Halt!” they cry,
        but none turns back.
    [9] Plunder the silver,
        plunder the gold!
    There is no end of the treasure
        or of the wealth of all precious things.
    
    
    [10] Desolate! Desolation and ruin!
        Hearts melt and knees tremble;
    anguish is in all loins;
        all faces grow pale!
    [11] Where is the lions’ den,
        the feeding place of the young lions,
    where the lion and lioness went,
        where his cubs were, with none to disturb?
    [12] The lion tore enough for his cubs
        and strangled prey for his lionesses;
    he filled his caves with prey
        and his dens with torn flesh.
    
    
      [13] Behold, I am against you, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will burn your(6) chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard.
