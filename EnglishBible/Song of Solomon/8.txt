Song of Solomon 8

Longing for Her Beloved

    [1] Oh that you were like a brother to me
        who nursed at my mother’s breasts!
    If I found you outside, I would kiss you,
        and none would despise me.
    [2] I would lead you and bring you
        into the house of my mother—
        she who used to teach me.
    I would give you spiced wine to drink,
        the juice of my pomegranate.
    [3] His left hand is under my head,
        and his right hand embraces me!
    [4] I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
        that you not stir up or awaken love
        until it pleases.
    
    
    [5] Who is that coming up from the wilderness,
        leaning on her beloved?
    
    
    Under the apple tree I awakened you.
    There your mother was in labor with you;
        there she who bore you was in labor.
    
    
    [6] Set me as a seal upon your heart,
        as a seal upon your arm,
    for love is strong as death,
        jealousy(1) is fierce as the grave.(2)
    Its flashes are flashes of fire,
        the very flame of the LORD.
    [7] Many waters cannot quench love,
        neither can floods drown it.
    If a man offered for love
        all the wealth of his house,
        he(3) would be utterly despised.
    
    
    Final Advice

    Others
    
    [8] We have a little sister,
        and she has no breasts.
    What shall we do for our sister
        on the day when she is spoken for?
    [9] If she is a wall,
        we will build on her a battlement of silver,
    but if she is a door,
        we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
    
    
    She
    
    [10] I was a wall,
        and my breasts were like towers;
    then I was in his eyes
        as one who finds(4) peace.
    
    
    [11] Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
        he let out the vineyard to keepers;
        each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
    [12] My vineyard, my very own, is before me;
        you, O Solomon, may have the thousand,
        and the keepers of the fruit two hundred.
    
    
    He
    
    [13] O you who dwell in the gardens,
        with companions listening for your voice;
        let me hear it.
    
    
    She
    
    [14] Make haste, my beloved,
        and be like a gazelle
    or a young stag
        on the mountains of spices.
