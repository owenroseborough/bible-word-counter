Song of Solomon 1



  [1] The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.

The Bride Confesses Her Love

    She(1)
    
    [2] Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
    For your love is better than wine;
    [3]     your anointing oils are fragrant;
    your name is oil poured out;
        therefore virgins love you.
    [4] Draw me after you; let us run.
        The king has brought me into his chambers.
    
    
    Others
    
    We will exult and rejoice in you;
        we will extol your love more than wine;
        rightly do they love you.
    
    
    She
    
    [5] I am very dark, but lovely,
        O daughters of Jerusalem,
    like the tents of Kedar,
        like the curtains of Solomon.
    [6] Do not gaze at me because I am dark,
        because the sun has looked upon me.
    My mother’s sons were angry with me;
        they made me keeper of the vineyards,
        but my own vineyard I have not kept!
    [7] Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
        where you pasture your flock,
        where you make it lie down at noon;
    for why should I be like one who veils herself
        beside the flocks of your companions?
    
    
    Solomon and His Bride Delight in Each Other

    He
    
    [8] If you do not know,
        O most beautiful among women,
    follow in the tracks of the flock,
        and pasture your young goats
        beside the shepherds’ tents.
    
    
    [9] I compare you, my love,
        to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariots.
    [10] Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
        your neck with strings of jewels.
    
    
    Others
    
    [11] We will make for you(2) ornaments of gold,
        studded with silver.
    
    
    She
    
    [12] While the king was on his couch,
        my nard gave forth its fragrance.
    [13] My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh
        that lies between my breasts.
    [14] My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
        in the vineyards of Engedi.
    
    
    He
    
    [15] Behold, you are beautiful, my love;
        behold, you are beautiful;
        your eyes are doves.
    
    
    She
    
    [16] Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful.
    Our couch is green;
    [17]     the beams of our house are cedar;
        our rafters are pine.
